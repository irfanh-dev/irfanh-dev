# Hi there! I'm Irfan Haider 👋
**Practical Tool-Builder & Code Hobbyist**

I'm a self-directed developer focused on one thing: **building tools that work.** Most of my projects are born out of a genuine need—if something is slowing me down, I write code to automate, improve, or simplify it. I prefer clear logic and useful solutions over complexity and big frameworks.


💡 **My Coding Philosophy: Building Practical Solutions**

I identify a problem and build around it, step by step. My goal is to create tools that actually get used, making everyday workflows faster, smoother, and more reliable.

**What I Build**
* Tools that **automate everyday tasks**.
* Browser-based utilities for organizing files, text, and workflows.
* Scripts that solve repetitive or time-consuming problems.
* Projects that fundamentally improve how we work or manage information.
